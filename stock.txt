Stock market from the basics. At this repository, on python, I'm showing the way, how to create your own stock market dataset, how to refresh it on a daily basis, and at the moment, when the files are uploaded, you can also create an own dataframe, whom you can get a signal, if any of your prefered stock has reached a buy level, you can set. All this, with using the yahoo database, some datetime object, and using a randomly selected stock for basic visualization, which will be further developed.
